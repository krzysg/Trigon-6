### Key combinations

#### Basic Preset
Basic preset is useful for creating a new sound from scratch:

1. Hold down the preset button.
2. Press the write button.


### Hidden/Sicret Key Combination (not official - might not work when OS changes!)

#### Checked on OS 1.1.2
HOLD + GLIDE + 3 - internal temperature

Another useful 'secret' button combo I've come across is turning the unit on while pressing 'hold'. This boots the unit into test mode where the values of any knob you turn will be displayed numerically on the bank readout. 

#### Not checked (yet)
*"Hold+Portamento+0" copies the User banks 000-499 to Presets banks 500-599.   

You can copy the user banks to the factory banks by holding down both transpose buttons (keyboard) or Hold and Portamento (desktop) and pressing 0, or copy the factory banks to the user banks by holding down the same combination and pressing 9.


NOTE: the combination to clear the temperature / tuning tables is not Manual+3 (as I erroneously wrote in my first post in this thread), but rather holding down "Hold+Portamento+4" on the desktop version.
DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISKS, since this will clear all tuning reference data and you will have to rebuild those tables by holding down "Manual+0" many times in the following days and weeks at different times and room temperatures in order to build it back up again. You have been warned.


### SysEx format:

#### 1. Unpacking Trigon's pitch data from its SysEx dumps.
[source](https://forum.sequential.com/index.php?topic=7017.0)

Sequential use a well-documented technique to pack 8-bit values into 7-bit data in their dumps.  This is fine for parameter values up to 255.  The two Osc pitch parameters, however, need to store values up to 1400 which needs 11 bits and won't fit in the standard structure.  I tried Sequential support but got no help with this, being pointed at Soundtower, as apparently if this works then all must be ok.
I made a number of dumps with different saved values and was able to figure out that the missing 3 bits per Osc are stored in bytes 50 and 51, so these need unpacking along with the LSB 7 bits and relevant bit from the MSB byte.  Easy to do once you know where to look.  Hope this helps anyone else who gets stuck on this.  I suggested to Sequential they update their documentation to include these hidden bytes.


#### 2. Sysex Instrument ID for Trigon? 
[source](https://forum.sequential.com/index.php/topic,6792.0.html)

ID of Trigon is 0x39

However in Manual Version 1.1 and all later versions of manual - English 1.2 from August, 2023 but also in German version from December, 2024 there is still:

```
0010 1101 - Trigon-6 ID
or
0010 1101 - Ger√§te-ID
```

In MIDI Implementation Chart 1.1 it seems to be almost corrected but there is strange 'b' in a number:

```
0b11 1001 - Trigon-6 ID
```
